\abstract{
Most of us use the internet every day, but do we really understand what it looks like? There is a very predictable tiered structure to the internet which makes it difficult visualise adequately. This project will attempt to use the properties of non Euclidean space, namely hyperbolic space, to produce visualisations of the internet based on geographic data. It is hoped that these visualisations could be used to further understanding of the internet and its structure.
